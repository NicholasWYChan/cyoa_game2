        <p>The year is 2090</p>
        <p>For nearly half a century, Earth was scorched into a man-made wasteland, forcing people to congregate inside
        the walls of what was habitable. Residing in such close spaces, authoritarianism ruled with such police figures
        known as Judges.
            <br><br>However, after significant &amp severe corruption fueled cognizance, the people of these Mega Cities
            forced a renaissance. For the sake of the blazing planet, scientists were able to research &amp begin a
            process to cool down climate, applying global showers. People were now able to exist outside the city walls,
            congestion decreased rapidly, and the need for iron fisted justice became politically demonized. The over-powering
            judge, jury, &amp executioners were now disbanded, outlawed, and considered fugitives. The sudden change had
            created a resistance amongst the Judges, whom were ordered to bring themselves in. A violent push back was
            imminent, knowing that behind those bars would be the people that they themselves had locked away. Only the ones
            who were the first to turn themselves in were granted a chance for re-education.
            <br><br> The return of situationalism has caused the justice system to pump the age old paradigm of investigation
            back into the streets. Detectives were back, with nerfed authoritative power but also a tall first order: Bring
            in any and all remaining Judges.
        </p>
            <p>As a former Judge, you have been granted a new beginning as part of the first wave of detectives. Your first assignment is not only tough but personal as you're forced to bring in the people who saw you as a colleague. The objective won't come easy, but with old habits, upholding strict law, you'll see this through.<br><br>

      <p>Your Adventure Begins</p>
            <p>With the new wave of detectives being forced onto the streets early and to patrol beyond the walls of the Mega City, the graduating class is spread too thin. With the people upstairs, believing it's best to wait until the second wave of graduates, there are no partners, and each man must perform his duty alone. <br><br>You get a call about a supposed Judge sighting nearby. Knowing how physically capable the Judges were, you make a quick decision to either sprint to the sighting or check the database. <br><br>

        <p>You decided to run</p>
        <p>There are ups and downs about the noir age of policemen. You're severely underequiped but at least that means less weight to carry. The new monsoon seasons have been getting heavier and heavier with midday being dark enough to contrast each artifical light through the streets. You notice a odd void between cabs by the curb. The first cabbie always goes first. Somebody ran through there. </p>

        <p>You revert back to HQ</p>
        <p>With the rush hour upon you, it would have been impossible to catch the Judge on foot. Instead you check the Mega City's CCTV for any clues on the suspect. The recordings show a tall figure running through the taxi line, causing a cabbie to screech to a hault. Despite the civilian clothing, you can see what could be bulky armor undearneath. This suspect is most definitely a Judge. Despite all that weight, you too would still be wearing bullet-proof equipment if you were being hunted.<br><br>Unfortunately, the call took place in the middle of rush hour, and there's a good chance the Judge was able to leg it far from the scene.</p>

        <p>Through the taxis and an alleyway, you come out the other side to a halted contruction site. It's a deep hole. There's no other sign of disturbances on the street and the trail has gotten cold. Did the supposed Judge make it down there or did he keep going?</p>

        <p>The newly created monsoon season is in full swing and it's beginning to pour hard. Visibility is low and the chances of finding the suspect is slim.

Still, the new PD protocol requires a detective to check the area.<br><br>It's rush hour, and the newly created monsoon season is in full swing. Everybody is either booking it from work to head home or ducking into an izakaya for happy hour. Amidst the pushing workers, during their exodus, you see a slightly taller hooded member of the crowd. His shoulders- certainly broader than the ones around him- you figure that this may be your guy. There's too many people around though, and he's most definitely carrying something more powerful than your sidearm.</p>
